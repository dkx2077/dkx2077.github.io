- Collaborated with researchers from the **independent research group of The University of Tokyo etc.** to design a multi-stage simulation framework utilizing LLMs. This framework analyzes how residents perceive, process, and respond to disaster risk information, aiming to enhance disaster management strategies by modeling cognitive and social decision-making behaviors.**(This work has been submitted to the *Systems* journal)**

- Under the guidance of Professor Wen from **Chengdu University of Technology**, We developed a novel detection model for brain tumor detection. This model outperforms state-of-the-art YOLO models in key metrics, demonstrating significant advancements in precision and efficiency on the Br35H dataset. **(This paper has been accepted by *PLOS ONE* journal)**
