- Collaborated with researchers from the **independent research group of The University of Tokyo etc.** to design a multi-stage simulation framework utilizing LLMs. This framework analyzes how residents perceive, process, and respond to disaster risk information, aiming to enhance disaster management strategies by modeling cognitive and social decision-making behaviors.**(This work has been submitted to the Systems journal.)**

- Collaborated with researchers from the **Chinese Academy of Sciences etc.** to develop a new benchmark designed to replace MMLU and MMLU-pro as the standard for LLM pre-training and fine-tuning. This dataset emphasizes a top-down, anthropologically structured distribution across 300+ academic disciplines and prioritizes reasoning logic over computational tasks, with rigorous decontamination and quality control to set a new benchmark for LLM development.

- Under the guidance of Professor Wen from **Chengdu University of Technology**, I developed a novel detection model, OS-DETR, for brain tumor detection, integrating an Orthogonal Channel Shuffle Module to enhance convolutional neural networks with orthogonal constraints and attention mechanisms. This model outperforms state-of-the-art YOLO models in key metrics, demonstrating significant advancements in precision and efficiency on the Br35H dataset. **(This paper has been submitted to the PLOS ONE journal.)**
